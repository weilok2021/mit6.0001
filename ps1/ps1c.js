// Understand the problem: 
// Utilize bisection search to figure out how much we need to save per month
// if we wanted to buy the house in 3 years(36 months)
// the annual rate and semi_annual_raise is just the same as ps1b.js
// Your semiÂ­annual raise is .07 (7%)
// Your investments have an annual return of 0.04 (4%)
// The down payment is 0.25 (25%) of the cost of the house
// The cost of the house that you are saving for is $1M.

// Planning: 
// Now we should calculate the dividend and new current_savings, new annual_salary for only 36 months 
// and this should be run inside a loop from (1 up to 10000), this range would be the portion_saved
// percentage that we want to search for, which means we need outer and inner loops for this. 

// Pseudocode
// Prompt user for starting annual salary
// Initialize total_cost to 1 million
// Initialize down_payment to 250K 
// Initialize semi_annual_raise to 0.07
// Initialize annual_rate to 0.04
// Initialize months to 36
// initialize portion_saved to 1
// Compute starting monthly salary using annual salary
// initialize current_savings with value 0

// While portion_saved <= 10000
//     Reset savings conditions as below
//     Declare dividend
//     Make a copy of current_savings 
//     Make a copy of annual_salary
//     Make a copy of monthly_salary
//     ForLoop from 1 upto and including months
// IF months modulo 6 === 0: increase copied annual salary by semi_annual_raise percentage
// Compute dividend of this month with copied current_savings
// Increase copied current savings with dividend plus (copied monthly salary * portion_saved)
// Increment steps
// Increment portion_saved
// IF current_savings >= down_payment
//     break out of the searching loop
// Print to screen the portion_saved (the amount user should save to get a house in 36 months)
